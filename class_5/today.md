Explain the concept of falsy and truthy values in JavaScript.
List the common falsy values: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN.
Describe truthy values as any value that is not falsy.
Highlight the importance of understanding these values in if-else statements.

# Topic 2: Boolean Conversion

Show how to use the Boolean() function to explicitly convert values to boolean.
Provide examples like console.log(Boolean(0)) and console.log(Boolean('Jonas')).

Introduce the switch statement as an alternative to if-else for multiple condition checks.
Explain the syntax of the switch statement and how it works.
Demonstrate the switch statement with your day example.

# Topic 5: Ternary Operator

Introduce the ternary operator as a concise way to write conditional expressions.
Explain the syntax of the ternary operator (conditional ? value_if_true : value_if_false).
Provide examples like the tip calculator challenge (without the solution) to show its usage.

# Topic 6: Coding Challenge #4 - Tip Calculator

Present the challenge to calculate tips based on bill values with specific conditions.
