Falsy and Truthy Values:

# Keep in mind that in JavaScript, certain values are considered falsy (evaluate to false in a boolean context)

# truthy (evaluate to true in a boolean context). This can affect the outcome of if-else statements.

# Falsy Values: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN

# Truthy Values: Any value that is not falsy

# Understanding if-else statements is crucial for making decisions in your code based on conditions.

# They provide the foundation for more complex decision-making structures and logic in JavaScript programs.

console.log(Boolean(0));
console.log(Boolean(undefined));
console.log(Boolean('Jonas'));
console.log(Boolean({}));
console.log(Boolean(''));

Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

# solution

const bill = 430;
const tip = bill <= 300 && bill >= 50 ? bill _ 0.15 : bill _ 0.2;
console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${bill + tip}`);
